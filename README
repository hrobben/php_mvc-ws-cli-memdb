Assignment
==========

Refactor the code so that it supports the following:

* The request/dispatch process can be triggered from other sources than a HTTP
  request. This could be via a WebSocket or directly from the command line, for
  example, with the request data being passed in some fixed format.

  You do not have to implement the other request types directly, as long as the
  process / flow for them is clear. If it helps the presentation of your
  solution you can augment your structure with (pseudo) code.

* The data source for models, now a file-based SQLite3 database, should be
  configurable at central location. For example, we would like to use an
  in-memory database for unit tests.

* The output can be something different than just the one from the current
  template engine. For example, XML or JSON output. This output format should
  be selectable in the request.  We would also want to be able to change
  template engines without changing too much code.

Any remarks on this system are welcome: what would you do different, what is it
missing or what does it do just plain wrong?

Note: the current setup would not work under Windows. It would be
possible to make it multi-platform, but this is not needed unless you are
working in Windows yourself.
